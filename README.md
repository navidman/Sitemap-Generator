#  Sitemap-Generator

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="arrow_down" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b07.png">⬇️</g-emoji> Installation

This is a test project to crawl application urls and generate a sitemap file.
First, you need to install wordpress. Then you need to add this plugin to it. After enabling this plugin a menu item named sitmap generator will add to the sidebar.
In sitemap generator you will see two buttons and an input. You can fill the input with any you url that you want to crawl. Then you can click on the "generate sitemap" and the application will crawl the url you provided and will generate sitemap. If you click on "last result" button, you will see the last result that you saved.
You can see sitemap.xml file in /sitemap.xml route. I am using file system and did not need any databases. 
I am looking forward for your feedback!
